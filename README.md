# FlexParser

Hello there! This is a WPF learning project that implements a simple site parser. Well, there is nothing more to explain, because this program is very simple. 

I can say that there are only 5 controls in the program. It's "Search string", "Resource", "Category", "Start Date" and "End Date".
"Search string" is responsible for finding articles with the specified string, "Resource" for the site from which the information is taken and "Category" for the category from site.
That's all.

Thx for reading.
